# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest tagged minor version receives security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
1. Do **not** open a public issue for sensitive security problems.
2. Instead, open a placeholder issue with the title: `security: request secure contact`.
3. A maintainer will provide a secure channel (email or encrypted method) to share details.
4. Provide reproduction steps, impact, and suggested mitigations if known.

## Disclosure
- We aim for a fix or mitigation within 14 days for high severity issues.
- Public disclosure occurs after a patch is available or by mutual agreement.

## Hardening Roadmap
See `ROADMAP.md` (Security & Scale milestone) for upcoming security improvements.
